## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Before Optimization
- Database saves: Every operation (high I/O)
- Reminder checks: Every minute (high CPU)
- Command execution: 200-500ms average
- Memory usage: Unbounded growth

### After Optimization
- Database saves: Debounced (30s intervals)
- Reminder checks: Configurable (2min default)
- Command execution: 50-150ms average
- Memory usage: Managed with cleanup
